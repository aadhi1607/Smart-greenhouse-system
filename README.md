# Smart-greenhouse-system
This project develops a smart greenhouse system using advanced technologies to optimize growing conditions of crops. The smart greenhouse features environmental sensors that continuously monitor temperature, light intensity, and soil moisture. These sensors provide real-time data to Arduino Due(controller), which automatically adjusts cooling, lighting, and irrigation systems. An automated irrigation system, guided by soil moisture data and weather forecasts, delivers precise water amounts, enhancing efficiency and preventing over- or under-watering. LED grow lights supplement natural light, ensuring optimal photosynthesis. Remote monitoring is achieved via integrating the Arduino Due with ESP8266 Node MCU which is connected to Wi-Fi at our home. It transmits sensor data such as
temperature, soil moisture and light intensity which can be accessed via smartphone or a PC. This project demonstrates significant improvements in crop yield, quality, and resource efficiency, contributing to sustainable agriculture and food security, and providing a practical solution for modern farming.
